MyToken (NKYK)
This Solidity program implements an ERC20 token named nickyinka with the symbol NKYK. It includes features such as minting, burning, and pausing, and is designed for deployment on the Ethereum blockchain.

Description
MyToken (NKYK) is an ERC20-compliant smart contract written in Solidity. It leverages the OpenZeppelin library to extend standard ERC20 functionality with additional features such as burnable, pausable tokens and ownership management. The owner of the contract has exclusive rights to mint, burn, pause, and unpause token transfers, making it a versatile and secure implementation for various use cases.

Getting Started
Dependencies
This contract requires the following OpenZeppelin contracts:

plaintext
Copy code
@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol
@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/ERC20Burnable.sol
@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/ERC20Pausable.sol
@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol
Executing Program
To deploy and interact with this contract, you can use a Solidity development environment such as Remix.

Create a New File:
Go to Remix, create a new file named MyToken.sol, and paste the following code:

contract MyToken is ERC20, ERC20Burnable, ERC20Pausable, Ownable {
    constructor(address initialOwner)
        ERC20("nickyinka", "NKYK")
        Ownable(initialOwner)
    {}

    function pause() public onlyOwner {
        _pause();
    }

    function unpause() public onlyOwner {
        _unpause();
    }

    function mint(address to, uint256 amount) public onlyOwner {
        _mint(to, amount);
    }

    function burn(address account, uint256 amount) public onlyOwner {
        _burn(account, amount);
    }

    function transfer(address recipient, uint256 amount) public override returns (bool) {
        _transfer(_msgSender(), recipient, amount);
        return true;
    }

    function _update(address from, address to, uint256 value)
        internal
        override(ERC20, ERC20Pausable)
    {
        super._update(from, to, value);
    }
}
Compile the Contract:
In the "Solidity Compiler" tab, ensure the compiler version is set to 0.8.19 (or another compatible version), and click the "Compile MyToken.sol" button.

Deploy the Contract:
In the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab, select the MyToken contract from the dropdown menu. Enter the address of the initial owner in the constructor's input field, and click "Deploy".

Interact with the Contract:
Once deployed, you can interact with the contract by calling functions like mint, burn, pause, and unpause using the provided UI in Remix.
