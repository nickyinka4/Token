# MyToken Smart Contract

This Solidity program defines a custom ERC20 token called "nickyinka" (NKYKA). The contract leverages OpenZeppelin libraries to include standard ERC20 functionality, as well as additional features like minting, burning, and pausing the token. The purpose of this contract is to serve as a foundational token for blockchain-based projects, with enhanced controls for the token owner.

## Description

The `MyToken` smart contract is a customizable ERC20 token implemented in Solidity. It uses OpenZeppelin's ERC20, ERC20Burnable, ERC20Pausable, and Ownable extensions to provide a secure and flexible token contract. Key features include:

- **Minting:** The contract owner can mint new tokens to any address.
- **Burning:** The contract owner can burn tokens from any address.
- **Pausing:** The contract owner can pause and unpause all token transfers.
- **Ownership:** Only the owner of the contract has permission to mint, burn, and manage the pausing of token transfers.

The contract is designed for deployment on the Ethereum blockchain and can be used as a foundation for various decentralized applications (DApps).
